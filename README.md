# llm-1-shakespeare

This repository contains code for building a language model to generate Shakespeare-style text content. The project leverages modern machine learning techniques to emulate the writing style of William Shakespeare.

## Features

- Train a language model on Shakespeare's works.
- Generate text in Shakespearean style.
- Customize the model for different text generation tasks.

## Project Structure

**.gitignore** - Specifies files to ignore in version control 

**input.txt** - Input text file containing training data (e.g., Shakespeare's works) 

**main-gpt.py** - Main script for training and generating text 

**README.md** - Project documentation

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt` if available):
  - `torch`
  - `transformers`
  - `numpy`

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Training Data**:
   - Place the text data (e.g., Shakespeare's works) in `input.txt`.

2. **Train the Model**:
   - Run the `main-gpt.py` script to train the model:
     ```bash
     python main-gpt.py
     ```

3. **Generate Text**:
   - After training, use the script to generate Shakespeare-style text:
     ```bash
     python main-gpt.py --generate
     ```

## Example Output

Hereâ€™s an example of the text generated by the model:

To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune...
